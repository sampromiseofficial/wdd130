                <h2> History</h2>
                <p>
                    Psalm Whitewater Rafting was founded in 2020 with a simple but powerful vision: 
                    to help people reconnect with nature and faith through the raw, 
                    exhilarating experience of whitewater rafting. Inspired by the peaceful strength of flowing rivers 
                    and the reflective power of the Psalms, our founders—outdoor enthusiasts 
                    and community leaders—set out to create more than just a rafting company.
                    What began as a small, family-operated service on one local river quickly gained momentum as 
                    word spread about our spiritually enriching and expertly guided rafting trips. 
                    Our early guests spoke of more than just adrenaline and scenery—they spoke of peace, renewal, and connection.
                    Over the years, Psalm Whitewater Rafting has expanded its operations to include multiple river routes, seasonal tours, 
                    and adventure packages for families, schools, corporate teams, and faith-based groups. 
                    Our team of certified guides and nature lovers is deeply committed to safety, stewardship, 
                    and creating experiences that inspire both thrill and reflection.
                    Today, Psalm Whitewater Rafting stands as a beacon for those who seek not just adventure, but meaning in the wild waters. Whether you’re navigating Class V rapids or 
                    floating through calm canyons, we’re here to guide you—physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
